            üìò What is the Catechism of the Catholic Church?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Catechism of the Catholic Church is a book that summarizes the
            essential teachings of the Catholic faith. It was first published in
            1992 under Pope John Paul II to serve as a clear and comprehensive
            guide to what the Church believes and teaches around the world.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The Catechism doesn&apos;t introduce new doctrine‚Äîit organizes and
            explains the faith the Church has always professed. It draws from
            Scripture, Tradition, and the Magisterium (the Church&apos;s
            teaching authority), and it quotes heavily from the Bible, the early
            Church Fathers, saints, councils, and other Church documents.
